Existence of a triangle on three sides, checking for an even odd number. Largest number. Checking positive or negative number

1.
You are given two variables x and y, you do not need to change them. Use the ternary operator to compare them and if x is greater than y, then print the phrase: "x is greater than y", otherwise print the phrase: "x is not greater than y".


2.
The user enters some number (num). Using the if..else construct, write code that makes a request: "Enter a number." If the visitor enters an even number, then display ""Number" + num + "even"", if odd: "Number" + num + "odd

3.
Write code that prompts the user to enter an integer. It is necessary to display on the screen how many digits are in this number, as well as whether it is positive or negative. For example, "Number" + num + "unique positive". It will be enough to determine whether the number is one-digit, two-digit or three-digit or more.

To find out the length of the string that the user entered in the prompt, you need to use


4.
Determine which of the three numbers entered by the user is the maximum and display it on the screen. The user enters numbers in turn through the prompt. Using the if..else construct, write code that must determine which of the entered numbers is the largest.

5.
For a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Otherwise, the two sides will simply "lie down" on the third and the triangle will not work. The user enters the lengths of the three sides one by one through the prompt. Using the if..else construct, write code to determine if a triangle can exist with these lengths. That is, you need to compare the sums of any two strings with the remaining third party. For a triangle to exist, the sum must always be greater than a single side.
